## Reproducibility

### Major concepts

- **Reproducibility** - A different analyst re-performs the analysis with the same code and the same data and obtains the same
result.
- **Repeatable** - keeping everything the same but repeating the analysis - do we get the same results
- **Reproducible** - using the same data and analysis but in the hands of another researcher - do we get the same results?
- **Replicable** - with new data do we obtain the same inferences?

### Functions
|Library/Package|Piece of code|Example of usage|What it does|
|---------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Base `R`| [`sessionInfo()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.6.2/topics/sessionInfo) |`sessionInfo()`| Returns the R version information, the OS, and the attached packages in the current R session.|

## Data Input/Output

### Major concepts

- **Delimited file** - columns within the file have boundaries created with some type of punctuation - for example, a csv file stands for comma separated values, thus the columns are delimited or separated by commas. txt files often use tabs.
- **tibble** â€“ a rectangular data frame, where data are split into rows and columns.
- **File path** - where a file lives on your computer (or on the internet) - [File paths can be relative or absolute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#Absolute_and_relative_paths).
- **Getting help** - For any function, you can write `?FUNCTION_NAME`, or `help("FUNCTION_NAME")` to
look at the help file for that function.
- [**R Projects**](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects) set the working directory where the .Rproj file is.
- **Reading in data (manual)** - *Download the data*, *Put data in the project folder*. Go to File, Import Dataset, From Text (`readr`), browse for the file, and finally click "Update" and "Import".

### Functions
|Library/Package|Piece of code|Example of usage|What it does|
|---------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
