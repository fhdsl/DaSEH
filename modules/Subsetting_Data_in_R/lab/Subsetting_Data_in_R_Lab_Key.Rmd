knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In this lab you can use the interactive console to explore but please record your commands here.  Remember anything you type here can be "sent" to the console with Cmd-Enter (OS-X) or Ctrl-Enter (Windows/Linux) (But only inside the code chunks designated with the ```{r}``` areas).

# Part 1

First let's load our packages. We're going to be using the `dplyr` package, which you can load as part of the `tidyverse` package.


```{r, message = FALSE}
# don't forget to load the packages that you will need!
library(tidyverse)
```

We'll again work with the CalEnviroScreen dataset, which contains information about environmental factors associated with human health in California.

First, load the data from the website, either manually or by using the Data Import menu (find it by clicking on File).

```{r}
ces <- read_csv(file = "https://daseh.org/data/CalEnviroScreen_data.csv")
```


Check that it worked by seeing if you have the `ces` data.

```{r 0response}
ces
```

### 1.1

What class is `ces`?

```{r 1.1response}
class(ces)
```

### 1.2

How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are in the dataset - try the `dim()` function?

```{r 1.2response}
dim(ces)
nrow(ces)
ncol(ces)
```

### 1.3

Next, rename the column `CaliforniaCounty` to `CA_county` (hint - use `rename()` and watch out for the order of the new and old names!). 

```{r 1.3response}
ces<- rename(ces, CA_county = CaliforniaCounty)
head(ces)
```

### 1.4

Convert the column names of `ces` to be all upper case. Use `rename_with()`, and the `toupper` command. Save this as a new dataset called `ces_upper`.

```{r 1.4response}
ces_upper <- rename_with(ces, toupper)
head(ces_upper)
dim(ces_upper)
```



# Practice on Your Own!

### P.1

How can you show the first 3 rows and the last 3 rows of `ces` (in two lines of code)?

```{r P.1response}
head(ces, 3)
tail(ces, 3)
```


# Part 2

### 2.1

Create a subset of the `ces` that only contains the columns: `CensusTract`, `Traffic`, and `Asthma` and assign this object to `ces_sub` - what are the dimensions of this dataset?

`CensusTract`: this is a small, relatively permanent area within a county used to present data from the census and other statistical programs

`Traffic`: A measure of traffic density in vehicle-kilometers per hour per road length, within 150 meters of the census tract boundary. A higher `Traffic` value indicates the presence of more traffic

`Asthma`: Age-adjusted rate of emergency department visits for asthma

```{r 2.1response}
ces_sub <- select(ces, CensusTract, Traffic, Asthma)
dim(ces_sub)
```

### 2.2

Start with `ces` again instead of the dataset you just made. Subset the data to only include the `CensusTract` column and the columns that end with "Pctl". Hint: use  `select()` and `ends_with()`. Assign this subset of the data to be `ces2`. Again take a look at the data and check the dimensions.

"Pctl" stands for "percentile". 

```{r 2.2response}
ces2 <- select(ces, CensusTract, ends_with("Pctl"))
ces2
dim(ces2)
```

### 2.3

Pull the variable `Asthma` from `ces_sub`. How does this differ from selecting it? Use head() to take a look at both options.

```{r 2.3response}
head(pull(ces_sub, Asthma))
head(select(ces_sub, Asthma))
```

### 2.4

Subset the rows of `ces_sub` that have **more** than 100 for `Asthma` - how many rows are there? Use `filter()`.

```{r 2.4response}
nrow(filter(ces_sub, Asthma > 100))

```

### 2.5

Subset the rows of `ces_sub` that have an `Asthma` value **more** than 100 and a `Traffic` value **less** than 500 and — how many are there?


```{r 2.5response}
filter(ces_sub, Asthma > 100 & Traffic < 500) # all of these options work
nrow(filter(ces_sub, Asthma > 100 & Traffic < 500))
nrow(filter(ces_sub, Asthma > 100, Traffic < 500))
```

### 2.6

Subset the rows of `ces_sub` that have an `Asthma` value **more** than 100 and a `Traffic` value **less than or equal to (`<=`)**  500 — how many are there?

```{r 2.6response}
filter(ces_sub, Traffic <= 500 & Asthma > 100) # all of these options work
nrow(filter(ces_sub, Asthma > 100 & Traffic <= 500))
nrow(filter(ces_sub, Asthma > 100, Traffic <= 500))
```

### 2.7

We used two different criteria for subsetting in 2.5 and 2.6. Why are the number of rows the same for 2.5 and 2.6?

```{r 2.7response}
# There are no rows with a Traffic value exactly equal to 500
```


# Practice on Your Own!

### P.2

Subset the rows of `ces` for rows that have `CA_county` of "Los Angeles",  **or** a `Traffic` value **less** than 300.

How many rows have both?

```{r P.2response}
filter(ces, CA_county == "Los Angeles" | Traffic < 300)
nrow(filter(ces, CA_county == "Los Angeles" & Traffic < 300))
```

### P.3

Select the variables that contain the letter "a" from `ces`. Remember, the variables are the column names.

```{r P.3response}
select(ces, contains("a"))
```


# Part 3

### 3.1

Create a subset called `ces_Alameda` from `ces` that only contains the rows for Alameda and only the columns: `Traffic` and	`Asthma`. `CA_county` should not be included in `ces_Alameda`.

What are the dimensions of this dataset? Don't use pipes (`|>`) and instead do this in two steps creating the `ces_Alameda` object with `filter` and updating it with `select`.

```{r 3.1response}
ces_Alameda <- filter(ces, CA_county == "Alameda")
ces_Alameda  <- select(ces_Alameda, Traffic, Asthma)
ces_Alameda # can get dimensions just from viewing the tibble
dim(ces_Alameda) # alternatively can use dim() function
```

### 3.2

Try the same thing again with pipes `|>`.

```{r 3.2response}
ces_Alameda <- ces |>
  filter(CA_county == "Alameda") |>
  select(Traffic, Asthma)
ces_Alameda
dim(ces_Alameda)
```

What happens if you do the steps in a different order? Why does this not work?

```{r, error = TRUE, label = '3.2aresponse'}
ces_Alameda <- ces |>
                 select(Traffic, Asthma) |>
                 filter(CA_county == "Alameda")
# you get an error because there is no CA_county variable to filter from
```

### 3.3

Re-order the rows of `ces_Alameda` by `Traffic` value in increasing order. Use `arrange()`. What's the smallest value?

```{r 3.3response}
ces_Alameda <- arrange(ces_Alameda, Traffic)
ces_Alameda
arrange(ces_Alameda, Traffic) |>
  head(n = 1) |>
  pull(Traffic)
```

### 3.4

Create a new variable in `ces_Alameda` called `Asthma100`, which  is equal to `Asthma` divided by 100, using `mutate()`(don't forget to reassign `ces_Alameda`). Use pipes `|>`. Take a look at the data now!

```
# General format
NEWDATA <- OLD_DATA |> mutate(NEW_COLUMN = OLD_COLUMN)
```

```{r 3.4response}
ces_Alameda <- ces_Alameda |> mutate(Asthma100 = Asthma/100)
ces_Alameda
```


# Practice on Your Own!

### P.4

Move the `Asthma100` column to be before `Traffic` in the `ces_Alameda` dataset. Use `relocate()`.

```{r P.4response}
ces_Alameda <- ces_Alameda |> relocate(Asthma100, .before = Traffic)
ces_Alameda
```

### P.5

Using the original `ces` data, how can you find the values of `ApproxLocation` for areas within zip code 90745 (in Los Angeles county) that also have a CES4.0 score in the range 90-95% - without just looking at the data manually and instead use functions we learned today? (Hint: It can be helpful to look at your data first)

`CES4.0PercRange`: Percentile of the CalEnviroScreen score, grouped by 5% increments. The CalEnviroScreen score is a measure of the negative environmental effects seen in a given region. Those zip codes that have a percentile range of 90-95% are those regions that experience the highest effects of pollution in California.

```{r P.5response}
ces |>
  filter(ZIP == 90745 & CES4.0PercRange == "90-95%") |>
  select(ApproxLocation)
```
