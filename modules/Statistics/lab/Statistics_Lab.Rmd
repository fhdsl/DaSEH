# Part 1

### 1.1

Load the packages needed in this lab. Then, read in the CalEnviroScreen data and assign it to the "ces" variable. You can find the data at https://daseh.org/data/CalEnviroScreen_data.csv


```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
```

```{r 1.1response}

```

### 1.2

Compute the correlation (with `cor`) between the `HousingBurden` and `LowBirthWeight` variables. 

* Use `select()` to choose these columns and save as an object. 
* Use the `cor` function on this object.
* Add the use = "complete.obs" argument.

`HousingBurden`: Percentage of housing-burdened low-income households. Households are considered cost-burdened when they spend more than 30% of their income on rent, mortgage payments, and other housing costs

`LowBirthWeight`: Percentage of births that are low birth weight.

```{r 1.2response}

```

### 1.3

Change your code from 1.2 to add a few more variables: 

* `DieselPM`: Diesel PM emissions from on-road and non-road sources. 
* `Traffic`: Measure of traffic density within 150 meters of the census tract boundary. 
* `Asthma`: Age-adjusted rate of emergency department visits for asthma. 

```{r 1.3response}

```

### 1.4

Perform a t-test to determine if there is evidence of a difference between low birth weight percentage (`LowBirthWeight`) in Los Angeles census tracts compared to San Diego:

* Create a subset of the data for `CaliforniaCounty == "Los Angeles"`
* Create a subset of the data for `CaliforniaCounty == "San Diego"`
* `pull` the `LowBirthWeight` column for both subsets
* Use `t.test` to compare the two pulled vectors
* Print the results using the `tidy` function from the `broom` package

```{r 1.4response}

```


# Practice on Your Own!

### P.1

Perform a t-test similar to 1.4, but this time examine differences in `HousingBurden`. 

```{r P.1response}

```

### P.2 

Filter `ces` so it only contains Los Angeles and San Diego. Launch Esquisse or create a ggplot which plots:

* `Lead` exposure on the x axis
* `HousingBurden` on the y axis
* Colors points (`geom_point()`) by `CaliforniaCounty`

```{r P.2response}

```


# Part 2

### 2.1

Fit a linear regression model with `LowBirthWeight` as the outcome and `HousingBurden` as the predictor. Save the model fit in an object called "lmfit_bw" and display the summary table with `summary()`.

`HousingBurden`: Percentage of housing-burdened low-income households. Households are considered cost-burdened when they spend more than 30% of their income on rent, mortgage payments, and other housing costs

`LowBirthWeight`: Percentage of births that are low birth weight.

```
# General format
glm(y ~ x, data = DATASET_NAME)
```

```{r 2.1response}

```

### 2.2

Take your code from 2.1 and add `Traffic` as another predictor. Save the model fit in an object called "lmfit_bw2" and display the summary table.

`Traffic`: Measure of traffic density within 150 meters of the census tract boundary

```{r 2.2response}

```


# Practice on Your Own!

### P.3

Take your code from 2.2 and add an interaction term. Save the model fit in an object called "lmfit_bw3" and display the summary table.

- To include the interaction, use `HousingBurden * Traffic` in the formula. 
- Save the model fit in an object called "lmfit_bw3" and display the summary table with `summary()`.

```{r P.3response}

```

### P.4   

Let's make `LowBirthWeight` into a binary variable, where over 5% low birth weight is "TRUE".

The following code creates a column `weight_cat` with TRUE/FALSE values.

```{r}
ces <- read_csv("https://daseh.org/data/CalEnviroScreen_data.csv")

ces_bw <- 
  ces %>% 
  mutate(weight_cat = LowBirthWeight > 5)
```

Fit a logistic regression model where:

* The outcome is `weight_cat`.
* `HousingBurden`, `Poverty`, and `Education` are predictors.
* Use `glm` and family = binomial(link = "logit").
* Save the model fit in an object called "logfit_bw" and display the summary table with `summary()`.

`Poverty`: Percent of population living below two times the federal poverty level

`Education`: Percent of population over 25 with less than a high school education

```{r P.4response}

```
