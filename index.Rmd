## Welcome!
***

Data Science for Environmental Health (DaSEH) is a short course that combines **online** learning and an **in-person** project-focused intensive. DaSEH is tailored for beginners and novices in R programming, offering instruction on importing, wrangling, visualizing, and analyzing data. It provides hands-on training in using R for statistical computing, a widely-used open-source tool for data analysis and visualization.

This training initiative is funded by National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [1R25ES035590-01](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/cMEAgQFeo025gUX1DDzH9g/project-details/10746327). 

### Two-week course

DaSEH begins with a two-week online course that solidifies R programming foundations. Participants learn best practices and ingrain programming skills via active hands-on lab activities. We will practice new skills one topic at a time to make the content more manageable! 

### Code-a-thon

The two-week foundation prepares participants a three-day in-person intensive “Code-a-thon”. Here, we'll work on authentic environmental health projects. We'll also practice data ethics skills in peer code review, reproducibility, and transparency in a supportive environment. 

### Instructors
