Data Science for Environmental Health (DaSEH) is a short course that combines **online** learning and an **in-person** project-focused intensive. DaSEH is tailored for beginners and novices in R programming, offering instruction on importing, wrangling, visualizing, and analyzing data. It provides hands-on training in using R for statistical computing, a widely-used open-source tool for data analysis and visualization.

This training initiative is funded by National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [1R25ES035590-01](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/cMEAgQFeo025gUX1DDzH9g/project-details/10746327).
