Data Science for Environmental Health (DaSEH) is a short course that combines **online** learning and an **in-person** project-focused intensive. DaSEH is tailored for beginners and novices in R programming, offering instruction on importing, wrangling, visualizing, and analyzing data. It provides hands-on training in using R for statistical computing, a widely-used open-source tool for data analysis and visualization.


 


This training initiative is funded by National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [1R25ES035590-01](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/cMEAgQFeo025gUX1DDzH9g/project-details/10746327). 




### Two-week course

DaSEH begins with a two-week online course that solidifies R programming foundations. Participants learn best practices and ingrain programming skills via active hands-on lab activities. We will practice new skills one topic at a time to make the content more manageable! 

### Code-a-thon

The two-week foundation prepares participants a three-day in-person intensive “Code-a-thon”. Here, we'll work on authentic environmental health projects. We'll also practice data ethics skills in peer code review, reproducibility, and transparency in a supportive environment. 

### Instructors

`r config::get("instructors")`

The lead instructors have earned recognition for excellence in teaching and have trained hundreds of professional learners. We can't wait to have you in class, too!

We're also supported by our data scientist, `r config::get("ds")`.
